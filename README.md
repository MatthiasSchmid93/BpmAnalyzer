# ![plot](./bpm.png) BpmAnalyzer Ver 2.0

![plot](./UI.png)

A BPM analyzer for live musicians that are using DAWs like Ableton,.. or Vjs that want play with other Artists together and focus more on the performance instead of wasting time finding the right tempo of a source that cannot digitaly be synced.

The operating range is between 110-160 BPM, as for now it only looks in this range.

The advantages:

- Very accurate regardless wich music genre (+-0.10)
- Ableton Link is integrated so it can connect to a wide range of VJ Software, DAWs and more
- MIDI mapping implementation for sending the BPM to the connected programms

Installation:

1. Download all files in the repository and save them in a new folder
2. Run BpmAnalyzer.py from the commandline
